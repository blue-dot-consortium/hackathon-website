Blue Dawn began as an idea among the Blue Dot universities, who wondered “what is the fastest, cheapest, and best Cube Satellite that can be built by undergraduate students?” A Cube Satellite is a class of Small Satellite that comes in 10cmx10cmx10cm “units” (or “U”). These tiny satellites have allowed universities to design, build, and fly their own space missions as tag-alongs to larger satellites. Now, we want to reimagine the university CubeSat community as more collaborative and interconnected than ever before, while also developing a strong proof of concept for a minimum viable CubeSat.

They also decided they neeed to promote their hackathon a little bit, so they put together this website.

## Testing the Site Locally

This is a Jekyll site run on GitHub Pages. To test something locally (i.e. you make a change and want to see what it does) install [`Ruby`](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and its package manager, [`Bundler`](https://bundler.io). Next, in the root directory of the repository, run: 

```Bundler
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then follow the prompt to the specified port in your web browser `https://localhost:4000`.
