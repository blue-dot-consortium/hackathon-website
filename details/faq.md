### What’s the Blue Dot Consortium?
The Blue Dot Consortium is a group of college space engineering clubs that share technical knowledge.

### Why ‘Blue Dot’?
The “Pale Blue Dot” is a famous picture of Earth, taken by the Voyager I spacecraft on February 14, 1990, from 6 Billion kilometers, or ~40 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. The Earth appears as a Pale Blue Dot, less than a pixel in size and barely visible within colorful bands of reflected sunlight. Read more on the Wikipedia page!
