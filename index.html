It is a Blue Dawn of the New Year and the Blue Dot Consortium is hosting a hackathon to get it started! For one weekend we will be bringing together (virtually) enthusiastic students from all fields and all walks of life to come together to dream up the future of university space travel. Whether you are a student space program veteran or brand new to the field this is your opportunity to join us with a clean slate.
