### What’s the Blue Dot Consortium?
The Blue Dot Consortium is a group of college space engineering clubs that share technical knowledge.

The Earth appears as a Pale Blue Dot, less than a pixel in size and barely visible within colorful bands of reflected sunlight. Read more on the Wikipedia page!
